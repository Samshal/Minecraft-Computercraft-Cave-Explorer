# Minecraft-Computercraft-Cave-Explorer
Minecraft Computercraft mod automated cave explorer for a turtle. Runs through a cave and lights it up with torches.

### Dungeon Explorer

Start turtle on the far right of a dungeon corridor. moves forward unless it sees that the block to the right of it is empty if it is it will turn right. 
if the turtle runs into a block it will turn left.

place a torch every 10

do the same as the above just with a turtle that starts on the left and turns left each time.

having two will explore the entire dungeon rather efficiently while lighting it up.

turtles inventory will need to by filled with torches and one empty spot. the empty spot will be used for comparing blocks for turns

### down falls:

if dungeon ends unexpectedly such as a ravine or cave. 

when sending turtles in it would be best to carry a drive with the program and extra turtles to start exploring extra corridors in case the turtle is lost.
